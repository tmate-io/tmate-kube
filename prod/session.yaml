# For networking, we want to users to be connect to the server via port 22
# (ssh), and port 443 (websockets). These connections are latency sensitive.
# We also want the servers to be able to know the user's IP.
# We'd like to have one session server in a few datacenters to provide low
# latency around the globe.
#
# We have a few options:
# 1) Use a load balancer. Because we are using SSH, we can't have a special
#    Client IP header. So we need to use the "PROXY protocol", which many load
#    balancers support. We have to write a bit of code to support the PROXY
#    protocol. This also increases the bill for each datacenter we want to
#    have a presence on.
# 2) Using a public IP on the node, and hostPort. Unfortunately, the SSH server
#    does not see the Client IP as connections are getting NATed.
# 3) Using a public IP on the node, and hostNetwork: true. This works, but
#    we have to relocate the port of the node's OpenSSH server on the machine.
#
# Using the node's public IP is not great as it's likely that things will go
# sour when doing k8s upgrades. Nodes may get recycled. Relocating the
# host SSH server is also a PITA. So We'll go with option 1) to avoid hassles.
